I hope you're having a nice week.  
Pottery was good this week. In fact, it was busiest I've ever seen it. Someone even bought their kid! Crazy. It's so nice to be back at the wheel. 
 I have been meaning to get in touch about something that's been on my mind. I have been through some ups and downs since we chose to go our separate ways last year and being able to stay friends with you has really helped me, mentally. I sincerely appreciate that. I hope you've felt the same. In the name of being honest and open with you, I feel it's only fair that I tell you that I have met someone new. I don't mean to bring this up to upset you and I really hope you have had a chance to meet new people. I have felt guity that I haven't told you yet and it's only right that you hear it from me first.  
 
I hope we can still be friends. You've been a great part of my life for many years.
